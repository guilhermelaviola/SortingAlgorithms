# SortingAlgorithms
Some code examples of sorting algorithms from my first graduation.

## BubbleSort
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed.

## MergeSort
Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being ÎŸ(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms. Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner.

## QuickSort
Quicksort is a highly efficient sorting technique that divides a large data array into smaller ones. A vast array is divided into two arrays, one containing values smaller than the provided value, say pivot, on which the partition is based. The other contains values greater than the pivot value.
